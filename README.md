# NoSQL Data Modeling and ETL with Apache Cassandra
## Date:6/26/2020

## Introduction
**Sparkify** is a startup which provides music streaming service. Their user log data are stored in CSV files, making it hard to peform analysis on top. This project is to create data model with NoSQL database based on the queries of interest and use ETL pipelines to populate data into tables. 

## Notes
This project is the second part of data modeling demo, which will focus on the NoSQL data modeling. For the relation data modeling, please refer to [PostgreSQL data modeling project.](https://github.com/Sherryljl/Data_Modeling_ETL_with_PostgreSQL)

## Knowledge needed
- Python
- Apache Cassandra
- NoSQL data modeling concepts
- ETL

## Files included
- event_data compressed file: contains orinigal user activity log data in CSV format.
- image_event_datafile_new.jpg: examples of user log data
- NoSQL_Data_Modeling_ETL_Cassandra.ipynb: used to pre-process original data files, finish data modeling and ETL pipelines. 


## How to use?
1. Unzip event_data into your local file system.
2. Place unzipped data folder and Jupyter Notebook under same directory.
3. Change the file paths in .ipynb accordingly, based on your own data and file location.
4. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run the codes.
